Having too many connections can be bad.

Let's say we have 64 ranks.

Let's say that we want the ranks to be grouped in 8.


Then, when rank 3 want to send a message to rank 55, it is required
to get the intermediate ranks.


rank 3 -> intermediate(rank 3) -> intermediate(rank 55) -> rank 55



rank 3 sends to rank 0
rank 0 sends to rank 48
rank 3 sends to rank 0
rank 0 sends to rank 48
rank 48 sends to rank 55
rank 48 sends to rank 55
