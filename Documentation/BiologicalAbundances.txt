With Ray, you can generate biological abundances.
This is done by providing Ray with a set of reference fasta sequences.
Ray Communities will use them to color the k-mers in the graph.



For example, let's say we have 1_1.fastq and 1_2.fastq containing a lot of sequences
from a given microbiome. To get the biological abundances of all NCBI viruses and
all NCBI bacteria as well as identified contigs, you can use Ray for that.

For any species that you want to check in your sample, you need to provide a single fasta
file. This file can contain chromosomes, genes, or both.

Now, you need a directory containing all viruses in fasta format (one virus per file) and
another directory containing all bacteria in fasta format (one bacterium per file as well).

These can be downloaded from NCBI right away.

== Command ==

mpiexec -n 64 Ray \
-p 1_1.fastq -p 1_2.fastq \
-search NCBI-bacteria-directory \
-search NCBI-viruses-directory \
-o RayMicrobiomeAnalysis

== Input directories ==

NCBI-bacteria-directory/ecoli.fasta
NCBI-bacteria-directory/spneumo.fasta
...

NCBI-viruses-directory/phix.fasta
...


== Output ==

RayMicrobiomeAnalysis/ contains the usual files.

For a list of output files, see Ray -help

The new files produced by the -search option are:


RayMicrobiomeAnalysis/
	BiologicalAbundances/
		_DenovoAssembly/
			Contigs.tsv
			*.CoverageData.xml

		_Coloring/
		_Frequencies/

		NCBI-bacteria-directory/
			ContigIdentifications.tsv
			_Files.tsv
			SequenceAbundances.xml

		NCBI-viruses-directory/
			ContigIdentifications.tsv
			_Files.tsv
			SequenceAbundances.xml



The virtual processor and communicator are heavily utilised here.
