With Ray, you can generate biological abundances.


For example, let's say we have 1_1.fastq and 1_2.fastq containing a lot of sequences
from a given microbiome. To get the biological abundances of all NCBI viruses and
all NCBI bacteria as well as identified contigs, you can use Ray for that.

For any species that you want to check in your sample, you need to provided a single fasta
file. This file can contain chromosomes, genes, or both.

Now, you need a directory containing all viruses in fasta format (one virus per file) and
another directory containing all bacteria in fasta format (one bacterium per file as well).

These can be downloaded from NCBI right away√©

== Command ==

mpiexec -n 64 Ray \
-p 1_1.fastq -p 1_2.fastq \
-search NCBI-bacteria-directory \
-search NCBI-viruses-directory \
-o RayMicrobiomeAnalysis

== Input directories ==

NCBI-bacteria-directory/ecoli.fasta
NCBI-bacteria-directory/spneumo.fasta
...

NCBI-viruses-directory/phix.fasta
...


== Output ==

RayMicrobiomeAnalysis/ contains the usual files.

For a list of output files, see Ray -help

The new files produced by the -search option are:


RayMicrobiomeAnalysis/
	BiologicalAbundances/
		DenovoAssembly/
			Contigs.tsv
			Identifications.tsv

		NCBI-bacteria-directory/
			Summary.tsv
			ecoli.tsv
			spneumo.tsv
			...

		NCBI-viruses-directory/
			Summary.tsv
			phix.tsv
			...

Each of these .tsv files (except Identifications which contains
identifications for contigs) contains these fields:


Category	SequenceName	LengthInKmers	Matches	Ratio	ModeKmerCoverage


For any category, there is a line with SequenceName set to 'All'. This line summarizes
the corresponding category.

The Summary.tsv files contain all the summary lines of the corresponding search
directory.


Identifications.tsv contains things that are similar to contigs.
Each line has these fields:

Contig	LengthInKmers	Category	SequenceName	LengthInKmers	Matches	Ratio
