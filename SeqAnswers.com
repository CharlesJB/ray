Dear SeqAnswers:

Ray, a massively parallel MPI-based approach to de Bruijn genome assembly with mixed technologies, is NOW available at http://denovoassembler.SourceForge.net/. It is 100% parallel, and it is a single executable (no pesky perl scripts!). The source code is licensed with the GPL-v3.

Please try it out, and tell us your comments, bugs, suggestions, and concerns on our mailing list.
