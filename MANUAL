  K-mer length

       -k kmerLength
              Selects the length of k-mers. The default value is 21. 
              It must be odd because reverse-complement vertices are stored together.
              The maximum length is defined at compilation by MAXKMERLENGTH
              Larger k-mers utilise more memory.

  Inputs

       -p leftSequenceFile rightSequenceFile [averageOuterDistance standardDeviation]
              Provides two files containing paired-end reads.
              averageOuterDistance and standardDeviation are automatically computed if not provided.

       -i interleavedSequenceFile [averageOuterDistance standardDeviation]
              Provides one file containing interleaved paired-end reads.
              averageOuterDistance and standardDeviation are automatically computed if not provided.

       -s sequenceFile
              Provides a file containing single-end reads.

  Outputs

       -o outputPrefix
              Specifies the prefix for outputted files.

       -amos
              Writes the AMOS file called PREFIX.AMOS.afg
              An AMOS file contains read positions on contigs.
              Can be opened with software with graphical user interface.

       -write-kmers
              Writes k-mer graph to PREFIX.kmers.txt
              The resulting file is not utilised by Ray.
              The resulting file is very large.

       -write-seeds
              Writes seed DNA sequences

       -write-extensions
              Writes extension DNA sequences

  Memory usage

       -show-memory-usage
              Shows memory usage. Data is fetched from /proc on GNU/Linux
              Needs __linux__

       -show-memory-allocations
              Shows memory allocation events

  Algorithm verbosity

       -show-extension-choice
              Shows the choice made (with other choices) during the extension.

       -show-ending-context
              Shows the ending context of each extension.
              Shows the children of the vertex where extension was too difficult.

       -show-distance-summary
              Shows summary of outer distances used for an extension path.

  Assembly options (defaults work well)

       -color-space
              Runs in color-space
              Needs csfasta files. Activated automatically if csfasta files are provided.

       -minimumCoverage minimumCoverage
              Sets manually the minimum coverage.
              If not provided, it is computed by Ray automatically.

       -peakCoverage peakCoverage
              Sets manually the peak coverage.
              If not provided, it is computed by Ray automatically.

       -repeatCoverage repeatCoverage
              Sets manually the repeat coverage.
              If not provided, it is computed by Ray automatically.

  Checkpointing

       -write-checkpoints
              Write checkpoint files

       -read-checkpoints
              Read checkpoint files

       -read-write-checkpoints
              Read and write checkpoint files

  Hardware testing

       -test-network-only
              Test the network and return.

  Debugging

       -run-profiler
              Runs the profiler as the code runs.
              Needs HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME=y at compilation
              Running the profiler increases running times.

       -debug-bubbles
              Debugs bubble code.
              Bubbles can be due to heterozygous sites or sequencing errors or other (unknown) events

       -debug-seeds
              Debugs seed code.
              Seeds are paths in the graph that are likely unique.

       -debug-fusions
              Debugs fusion code.
