v. 1.0.0
rXXXX | 2010-11-23

* Made a lots of changes to make Ray compliant with the standard MPI 2.2
(Ticket #558)
* Added master and slave modes
* Added an array of master methods (pointers): selecting the master method
with the master mode is done in O(1) (Tickets #545 & #546)
* Added an array of slave methods (pointers): selecting the slave method
with the master mode is done in O(1) (Tickets #545 & #546)
* Added an array of message handlers (pointers): selecting the message handler method
with the message tag is done in O(1) (Ticket #539)
* Replaced MPI_Send by MPI_Isend. Thanks to Open-MPI developpers for their
support and explanation on the eagerness of Open-MPI: George Bosilca (University of Tennessee), Jeff Squyres (Cisco), Eugene Loh (Oracle)
* Moved some code for the extension of seeds. (Ticket #114)
* Grouped messages for library updates. (Ticket #157)

* Fixed a memory allocation bug when the code runs on 512 cores and more.
(Ticket #520)

chunks. (Ticket #538)

#554, #555, #556, #557)
* Implemented a ring allocator for inboxes and outboxes. (Ticket #559)
