* Added an error message for an invalid extension. Thanks to Jean-Francois
Pombert (University of British Columbia) for the feature request.

= v. 1.0.0 =
2010-11-25

* Made a lots of changes to make Ray compliant with the standard MPI 2.2
* Added master and slave modes.
* Added an array of master methods (pointers): selecting the master method
with the master mode is done in O(1).
* Added an array of slave methods (pointers): selecting the slave method
with the master mode is done in O(1).
* Added an array of message handlers (pointers): selecting the message handler method
with the message tag is done in O(1).
* Replaced MPI_Send by MPI_Isend. Thanks to Open-MPI developpers for their
support and explanation on the eagerness of Open-MPI: George Bosilca (University of Tennessee), Jeff Squyres (Cisco), Eugene Loh (Oracle)
* Moved some code for the extension of seeds.
* Grouped messages for library updates.
* Added support for paired-end interleaved sequencing reads (-i option)
Thanks to Dr. Torsten Seemann (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium, Dept.
Microbiology, Monash University, AUSTRALIA) for suggesting the feature !
* Moved detectDistances & updateDistances in their own C++ file.
* Updated the Wiki.
* Decided that the next release was 1.0.0.
* Added support for .fasta.gz and .fastq.gz files, using libz (GZIP).
Thanks to Dr. Torsten Seemann (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium,
Dept. Microbiology, Monash University, AUSTRALIA) for suggesting the feature !
* Tested with k=17: it uses less memory, but is less precise.
* Fixed a memory allocation bug when the code runs on 512 cores and more.
* Added configure script using automake & autoconf.
Note that if that fails, read the INSTALL file !
* Moved the code that loads fasta files in FastaLoader.
* Moved the code that loads fastq files in FastqLoader.
* Regulated the communication in the MPI 'tribe'.
* Added an assertion to verify the message buffer length before sending it.
* Modified bits so that if a message is more than 4096 bytes, split it in
chunks.
* Used a sentinel to remove two messages, coupled with TAG_REQUEST_READS.
* Stress-tested with MPICH2.
* Implemented a ring allocator for inboxes and outboxes.
* Changed flushing so that all use <flush> & <flushAll> in BufferedData.
* Changed the maximum message size from 4096 to 4000 to send messages eagerly
more often (if it happens). Thanks to Open-MPI developpers for their
support and explanation on the eagerness of Open-MPI: Eugene Loh (Oracle), George Bosilca
(University of Tennessee), Jeff Squyres (Cisco).
* Changed the way sequencing reads are indexed: before the master was
reloading (again !) files to do so, now no files are loaded and every MPI ranks
participate in the task.
* Modified the way sequences are distributed. These are now appended to fill the buffer, and
the sentinel called 'End of transmission' is used. Thanks to
Élénie Godzaridis for pointing out that '\0' is not a valid sentinel for
strings !
* Optimized the flushing in BufferedData: flush is now destination-specific.
O(1) instead of O(n) where n is the number of MPI ranks.
* Optimized the extension: paired information is appended in the buffer in
which the sequence itself is.
* Added support for .fasta.bz2 & .fastq.bz2. This needs LIBBZ2 (-lbz2)
* Added instructions in the INSTALL file for manually compiling the source in
case the configure script gets tricky (cat INSTALL).
* Added a received messages file. This is pretty useless unless you want to
see if the received messages are uniform !.
* Added bits to write the fragment length distribution of each library.
* Changed the definition of MPI tags: they are now defined with a enum.
Thanks to Élénie Godzaridis for the suggestion.
* Changed the definition of slave modes: they are now defined with a enum.
Thanks to Élénie Godzaridis for the suggestion.
* Changed the definition of master modes: they are now defined with a enum.
Thanks to Élénie Godzaridis for the suggestion.
* Optimized finishFusions: complexity changed from O(N*M) to O(N log M).
* Designed a beautiful logo with Inkscape.
* Added a script for regression tests. 
* Changed bits so that a paired read is not updated if it does not need it
* Changed the meaning of the -o parameter: it is now a prefix.
* Added examples with MPICH2, Open-MPI, and Open-MPI/SunGridEngine.
* Changed DEBUG for ASSERT as it activates assertions.
* Updated the citation in the standard output.
* Corrected the interleave-fastq python script.
* Changed the license file from LICENSE to COPYING.
* Removed the trimming of reads if they are not read from a file.
* Increased the verbosity of the extension step.
* Added gnuplot scripts.
* Changed the file name for changes: from NEWS to ChangeLog.
* Optimized the MPI layer: replaced MPI_Iprobe by MPI_Recv_init+MPI_Start.
see MessagesHandler.cpp !
(Thanks to George Bosilca (University of Tennessee) for the suggestion !
