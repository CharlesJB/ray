You need a C++ compiler (g++ will do) and a MPI implementation (MPICH2 or Open-MPI will do).


1 ) using autoconf/automake

tar -xjf Ray-version.tar.bz2
cd Ray-version
./configure --prefix=~/software/Ray-version
make 
make install

The installer will use the first mpic++ found in your PATH.
GZIP and BZIP2 support is detected automatically.



2 ) using mpic++ manually (always works, but less handy)


If the above don't work for you (for various reasons), compile Ray using the following command:


make -f makefile.alternate


If you don't have libz and libbz2:



make -f makefile.alternate nocompression
