== OpenAssembler: assembling genome with mixed sequencing technologies ==

<b>OpenAssembler</b> assembles Illumina reads or 454 + Illumina reads, or any combination without non-random error incorporation. The manuscript is under review. Its novelty is that it avoids both 454's homopolymers and Illumina's short read length. Unlike EULER-SR, Velvet, or ABySS, OpenAssembler can assemble reads obtained from a mix of technology. However, it runs only on one process. 

=== Manuscript ===

We submitted a manuscript on 15 October 2009. The source code will be available upon acceptance.

== Ray: a massively parallel MPI-based approach to de Bruijn genome assembly with mixed technologies ==

<b>Ray</b> is a parallel version utilizing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface MPI]. The code is very different because of the heavy communication between MPI processes.

Our team started developing Ray on 2010-01-21 10:41:09 -0500. 

=== Features ===

Ray

* is massively parallel,
* supports the mixing of sequencing technologies, as long as the error incorporation is random,
* supports paired-end reads,
* does not write pesky intermediate large binary files,
* is licensed with the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GPL version 3],
* is implemented in c++,
* distributes computations across MPI processes,
* distributes data across MPI processes,
* is tested with [http://open-mpi.org/ Open-MPI],
* runs on [http://www.linux.com/ GNU/Linux],
* uses bit shifts and other optimizations,
* supports a vertex size up to 31,
* uses splay trees, and
* runs on one and more MPI processes.
