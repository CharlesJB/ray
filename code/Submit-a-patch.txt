You can clone the ray git repository.

	git clone git://github.com/sebhtml/ray.git

After making some changes to Ray, you can prepare a patch with

	git-format-patch


You can send your patch on the mailing list 


denovoassembler-devel AT lists.sourceforge.net


A patch should:

- be concise
- address one issue/bug/feature (not many)
- be easy to review
- should compile cleanly with -std=c++98 -Wall with g++
- should pass all system tests and all unit tests


A patch should not:

- change substantially the Ray architecture (i.e.: prototypes)
- contain change related to unrelated issues (i.e. adding support for X _AND_ fixing bug Y)
     (in that case, submit 2 patches)
