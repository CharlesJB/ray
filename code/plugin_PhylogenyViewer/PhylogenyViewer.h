3. for each sequence, also add an extra color for its genome identifier using a distinct namespace
4. Color things

1. Use the vertices to get a list of identifiers.
2. With this list, load only the relevant pairs from Genome-to-Taxon.tsv. (use an iterator)
x. generate a list of relevant taxon identifiers

y. iteratively load the tree of life (using an iterator-like approach) and fetch things to complete paths to root

5. For each vertex, get the best guess in the tree
	for instance if a k-mer has 3 things on it, try to find a common ancestor in the tree
6. synchronize the tree with master
7. output BiologicalAbundances/_Phylogeny/Hits.tsv
