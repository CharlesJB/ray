* Fixed many bugs in Ray when k is lower than 25 (when k=21, in particular)
(trac #88)
* Fixed segmentation fault when loading helicos data (trac #86)
* Made some changes after analyzing how the word length is impacting the
assembly of the public dataset SRA001125 (trac #81)
* Modified the Parallel_Ray_Engine (now version 0.0.4) to handle mixed
datasets (tested on the public dataset SRA003611) (trac #79)
* Implemented a dead-end detector for unpaired short reads (trac #20)
* Fixed segmentation fault when no input is provided (trac #82)
* Changed Ray's default behavior when no peak is observed in the coverage
(trac #80)
* Added public dataset links on the web page (trac #77)
* Fixed a serious flaw in Parallel_Ray_Engine that led to segmentation faults
(trac #76) (this flaw was kindly reported by Dr Torsten Seemann @  Victorian
 Bioinformatics Consortium -- thank you!)
* Changed the behavior of memory allocators in message passing --
   Ray now reuses allocated memory for ingoing and outgoing messages
   (10 MB for each).
* Added a mummer validation script (r3090)

* Ray now outputs assemblies in AMOS format (with -a), (trac #58)
* Ray commands can be provided with a commands file (like in 0.0.3 and 0.0.4)
as well as with command-line arguments, (trac #94) and
* Ray removes non-A-T-C-G letters at both ends of reads.

* 'make test' now performs unit tests (trac #83)
* 'make simtools' compiles simulation tools (trac #43)
* ignore coverage at 255 or more in the coverage distribution (trac #105)
* reduced number of contigs and error rates (trac #103 #106 #107 #110 #111
#118)
* MPI messages are grouped together in up-to-4096-bytes messages, when
possible (trac #114)
* unroll some loops to gain performance (trac #117)
* scripts included to do benchmarks
* improved AMOS file generation
* corrected the loader for color-space reads (thanks to sparks from
seqanswers.com)
* some code refactoring to reduce the size of Machine.cpp
* Comparison with other assemblers
