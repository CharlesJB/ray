* possibly use a map<,> to hold information on path lengths.
* use only the MODE constants for modes.
* load paired reads.
* use paired-end reads. to resolve repeats.
* speed hack:   when extending reverse-complement paths, only thread reads at the ~1000 last vertices.
* remove commented c++ code
* commit results for Human genome chromosome 1 unpaired. 50 bp reads.
* commit results for SRA001125 unpaired.


* support 454's homopolymers. LOL (use the SRA003611 454 data)
* support polymorphic genomes (which data to use, simulated data?)
