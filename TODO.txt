* extension does not work on test2 yet.

* when encountering assembled vertex, use a merger strategy?
* check memory allocation for master...
* replace reads positions with (int,int)
* extend in both direction too. 
* use single-end reads to resolve repeats.
* attach reverse complement vertices.
* load paired reads.
* use paired-end reads. to resolve repeats.
