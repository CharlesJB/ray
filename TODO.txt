* do some merging between contigs (test on Ecoli400 dataset.)

* add a DEFINE for the Isend or Send.
* remove commented c++ code
* add progression for fusion in stdout.
* add an early-stop technology (To speed up the process.)

* possibly use a map<,> to hold information on path lengths.
* use only the MODE constants for modes. (lots of work, will break things.)
* load paired reads. (test on SpPaired)
* use paired-end reads. to resolve repeats. (teste on SpPaired)
* speed hack:   when extending reverse-complement paths, only thread reads at the ~1000 last vertices.
* commit results for Human genome chromosome 1 unpaired. 50 bp reads.
* commit results for SRA001125 unpaired.

* support 454's homopolymers. LOL (use the SRA003611 454 data)
* support polymorphic genomes (which data to use, simulated data?)
