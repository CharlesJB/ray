* add early-stop trick
* add path-merging.


* use only the MODE constants for modes.
* make it work on SRA001125.
* try on human genome chromosome 1.
* load paired reads.
* use paired-end reads. to resolve repeats.

* speed hack:
  when extending reverse-complement paths, only thread reads at the ~1000
last vertices.
