* use single-end reads to resolve repeats.
* with the seed, store directions in the graph, then, use these direction to assemble the thing..

* extends seeds in one direction. (stop when an overlap (> 1000 vertices) with a previous wave
	* is found)
	* duplicate waves on other strands.
	* use waves to build contigs.

* use easy-start technology to make the process faster. 

* make it work on SRA001125.
* try with a barrier=1000
* find out why the extension is slow (?).
* remove the line break before the Minimum Coverage
* try on human genome chromosome 1. (started.)
* remove paired end read class.
* load paired reads.
* use paired-end reads. to resolve repeats.
