v. 0.1.0
2010-11-03

* Moved some code from Machine.cpp to new files.



v. 0.0.7
r3372 | 2010-04-24 08:17:54 -0400

* (Small) speed improvement in seed extension (trac #21)
* Ray can now write to user-specified files -- Huge thanks to Matthew
MacManes (University of California -- Berkeley) for suggesting this (trac #163)
* Changed the allocator size to 0x1000000 (trac #162)
* Ray can now estimate paired distances -- thanks to Torsten
Seemann (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium, Dept. Microbiology, Monash
University, AUSTRALIA) for his expertise (trac #159 158 #156 #131)
* Each MPI process now has a forest of 0x1000 splay trees, which are frozen
(no more splay operations) after no more items are inserted. (trac #151 #150
#149)
* Added running times in comparisons, as wisely suggested by Matthew MacManes
(University of California -- Berkeley) (trac #136)
* Ray is now better with a large peak coverage, and is more careful
otherwise. (trac #135 #134)
* Some improvements on mix datasets (trac #132)
* Ray is now robust when parsing arguments, and will complaint if something
is messy -- thanks to Torsten Seemann (Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium, Dept. Microbiology, Monash 
University, AUSTRALIA) for noticing the issue (trac #129)


v. 0.0.6
r3269 | 2010-04-10 08:38:09 -0400

* 'make test' now performs unit tests (trac #83)
* 'make simtools' compiles simulation tools (trac #43)
* ignore coverage at 255 or more in the coverage distribution (trac #105)
* reduced number of contigs and error rates (trac #103 #106 #107 #110 #111
#118)
* MPI messages are grouped together in up-to-4096-bytes messages, when
possible (trac #114)
* unroll some loops to gain performance (trac #117)
* scripts included to do benchmarks
* improved AMOS file generation
* corrected the loader for color-space reads (thanks to sparks from
seqanswers.com)
* some code refactoring to reduce the size of Machine.cpp
* Comparison with other assemblers 


v. 0.0.5
r3171 | 2010-03-29 10:15:17 -0400

* Ray now outputs assemblies in AMOS format (with -a), (trac #58)
* Ray commands can be provided with a commands file (like in 0.0.3 and 0.0.4)
as well as with command-line arguments, (trac #94) and
* Ray removes non-A-T-C-G letters at both ends of reads.


v. 0.0.4
r3132 | 2010-03-22 21:26:38 -0400

* Fixed many bugs in Ray when k is lower than 25 (when k=21, in particular)
(trac #88)
* Fixed segmentation fault when loading helicos data (trac #86)
* Made some changes after analyzing how the word length is impacting the
assembly of the public dataset SRA001125 (trac #81)
* Modified the Parallel_Ray_Engine (now version 0.0.4) to handle mixed
datasets (tested on the public dataset SRA003611) (trac #79)
* Implemented a dead-end detector for unpaired short reads (trac #20)
* Fixed segmentation fault when no input is provided (trac #82)
* Changed Ray's default behavior when no peak is observed in the coverage
(trac #80)
* Added public dataset links on the web page (trac #77)
* Fixed a serious flaw in Parallel_Ray_Engine that led to segmentation faults
(trac #76) (this flaw was kindly reported by Dr Torsten Seemann @  Victorian
Bioinformatics Consortium -- thank you!)
* Changed the behavior of memory allocators in message passing --
Ray now reuses allocated memory for ingoing and outgoing messages
(10 MB for each).
* Added a mummer validation script (r3090)
